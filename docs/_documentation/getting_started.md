Sortera is all about simplicity. To quickly make a table sortable, include the following script tag somewhere in your document.

```html
<script src="//cdn.56k.guru/js/sortera/latest/sortera.min.js"></script>
```

... and call sortera() with a element as the first parameter.

```javascript
sortera(document.getElementById('#thetable'));
```

Done!
